# DM852-CPP
This repository tracks my exercises and assignments with regard to the course DM852 (<a>https://odin.sdu.dk/sitecore/index.php?a=searchfagbesk&internkode=dm852&lang=en</a>) at University of Southern Denmark, which is one of my PhD courses.

## Lab 1. Creating a List class with various member functions in C++ under a namespace "DM852"
The code is under the folder <code>Lab1-List</code>. Use <code>g++ -g -c -o test_list.o list.cpp</code> to compile the .cpp file.
